# Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon

- Most of us have heard about the Kevin Bacon game
- The game requires a group of players to try to connect any Hollywood actor to Kevin Bacon as quickly as possible and in as few links as possible
- But why Kevin Bacon!?
- No doubt he is a prolific and versatile actor but are there others like him or maybe more connected and influential than him
- Let’s hunt for a better substitute actor who is relatively young, prolific, deeply entangled in the network

The python code project_network in the current repo has the code to load the imdb dataset, network formation and the analysis for finding a better substitiute to Kevin Bacon using Network sampling, Clustering, all types of centralities etc

Couldn't share the imdb dataset as it is too big. But contact me (parthvadera@gmail.com)  if you want to reporduce the result or just need the imdb dataset.

## Actors of interest 
- Kevin Bacon
- Nicolas Cage
- George Clooney
- Tom Cruise
- James Franco
- Tom Hanks 
- Samuel L. Jackson
- Ben Affleck
- Brad Pitt
- Keanu Reeves

## The hollywood network:
Filter: Made after 1960
- Number of Nodes: ~1.2 Million
- Number of Edges: ~2.8 Million

Since the network is huge, it would be comptationally expensive to find the clusters and some centrality measures
## Sampling 
- Three types of sampling methods considered.
- DFS – It samples an unvisited neighbor of the most recent visited vertex without     backtracing
- BFS - It samples an unvisited neighbor of the earliest visited vertex and each node is visited at most once.
- Random Walk – Random Walkers sample the network through diffusion

- Black is the original network
- Red is BFS which is biased  towards node with high degree as expected 
- Blue is DFS, biased like BFS
- Orange is random walk
- BFS does a better job of approximating the network  ( ~1.1 million edges)

## K-core Decomposition
- A k-degenerate graph is an undirected graph in which every subgraph has a vertex of degree at most k: that is, some vertex in the subgraph touches k or fewer of the subgraph's edges. 
- All actors except Ben Affleck lie in the 11th core for entire dataset. Ben sits in the 9th one.
- But for the sampled dataset k-core for all the actors is 1

## The Verdict

## Jackson is the new Bacon

## Community Detection
- Tried using community_fastgreedy from the package igraph, with 5 desired clusters as input to seprate Hollywood from other movie industries.
- Clusters from this output wasn’t able to segregate Hollywood. (Maybe because the algorithm is greedy)
- Computed the partition of the graph nodes which maximizes modularity i.e. the highest partition of the dendogram
- Generated by the Louvain algorithm
- 21874 communities detected with modularity 0.8345
