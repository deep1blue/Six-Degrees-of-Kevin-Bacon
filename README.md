# Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon

- Most of us have heard about the Kevin Bacon game
- The game requires a group of players to try to connect any Hollywood actor to Kevin Bacon as quickly as possible and in as few links as possible
- But why Kevin Bacon!?
- No doubt he is a prolific and versatile actor but are there others like him or maybe more connected and influential than him
- Letâ€™s hunt for a better substitute actor who is relatively young, prolific, deeply entangled in the network

The python code project_network in the current repo has the code to load the imdb dataset, network formation and the analysis for finding a better substitiute to Kevin Bacon using Network sampling, Clustering, all types of centralities etc

Couldn't share the imdb dataset as it is too big. But contact me (parthvadera@gmail.com)  if you want to reporduce the result or just need the imdb dataset.
